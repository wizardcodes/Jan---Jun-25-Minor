# Jan---Jun-25-Minor

So, for our 6th-semester minor project-2, we built something really cool: an IoT-based weather monitoring system! The official title was "Designing and Implementing an IoT Based Weather Monitoring System For Real Time Data Collection And Analysis," which sounds a bit formal, but basically, we created a system that collects weather data in real-time.

Setting up a bunch of sensors that can tell us things like the temperature, humidity, AQI {Air Quality Index} and even air pressure right at that moment.

For understanding the current environmental conditions better. It was a fantastic way to combine our electronics engineering knowledge with the practical applications of IoT. Super hands-on and a great learning experience!
